### Hey!

At the age of 16, I put my first computer together. With no one around that I could go to for help, I did everything I could to make sure I had all the right information, the right parts, everything down to the right cables. When my computer turned on for the first time, I was hooked. I took that passion into the military and worked on their networks and servers. After serving for 5 years, I knew I wanted to stay working with computers and technology but I wanted to have more creativity and control over what I was working on. I will always be greatful for the day the Resilent Coders came into my life and gave me the tools necessary to make my dreams come true. I am adaptable, resourceful, dependable and I am looking forward to taking my innate motivation and applying it to my career.
